"Gimme-the-data"  A data scraper thing.

14June18: Just starting on this doc.

Pulls data from Yahoo and Google and saves to a MongoDB

Tech points:
#AngleSharp to pull remote data
	Handles login and data grab in one tool. HAP was alternative for data but that left us with the login issue. I thought Selenium - though a gret test tool was a hack for the login in problem.

#.NET etc
		Part of the requirements.
		
*2do
 MongoDB - mLab
 front end - next up
